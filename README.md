# file-slayer
**Description**: 
A powerful Python script for CTF players and security researchers to safely clean, analyze, and manage files/directories. Features secure deletion, file hashing (MD5/SHA1/SHA256), metadata extraction, and pattern-based filtering with backup protection.  
**Caution** ⚠️:  
Permanently deletes files! Always test with --info or -v first.  Use -b to enable backups (file_manager_backup/).  Double-check exclusions (-e) to avoid losing critical files.
